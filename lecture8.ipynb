    "## String Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already mentioned the string functions `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `strcmp`, found in `<string.h>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, s and t are char * â€™s, and c and n are ints.\n",
    "\n",
    "`strcat(s,t)` concatenate t to end of s\n",
    "\n",
    "`strncat(s,t,n)` concatenate n characters of t to end of s\n",

    "## Character Class Testing and Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Several functions from `<ctype.h>` perform character tests and conversions. In the following, c is an int that can be represented as an unsigned char or EOF. The function returns int.\n",

    "The function `system(char *s)` executes the command contained in the character string s, then resumes execution of thecurrent pr ogram. The contents of s depend strongly on the local operating system. As a trivial example, on UNIX systems,\n",

    "## Storage Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `malloc` and `calloc` obtain blocks of memory dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "`void *malloc(size_t n)`\n",
    "returns a pointer to n bytes of uninitialized storage, or NULL if the request cannot be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "`void *calloc(size_t n, size_t size)`\n",
    "returns a pointer to enough free space for an array of n objects of the specified size, or NULL if the request cannot be satisfied.\n",
    "The storage is initialized to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pointer returned by malloc or calloc has the proper alignment for the object in question, but it must be cast into the appropriate type, as in\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    int * ip;\n",

    "    </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "`free(p)` frees the space pointed to by p, where p was originally obtained by a call to malloc or calloc. There are no restrictions on the order in which space is freed, but it is a ghastly error to free something not obtained by calling malloc or calloc. **Again, K&R are optimistic here!**\n",

    "## Mathematical Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more than twenty mathematical functions declared in `<math.h>`; here are some of the more frequently used. Each takes one or two double arguments and returns a double.\n",

For a binary file, the position is set to offset characters from origin, which may be `SEEK_SET` **(beginning)**, `SEEK_CUR` **(current position)**, or `SEEK_END` **(end of file)**. For a text stream, offset must be zero, or a value returned by ftell (in which case origin must be SEEK_SET). fseek returns non-zero on error.\n",

Add M circles, again containing and uniform distribution of particles. Such circles must have radii R_1, R_2... R_M and number of particles C_1, C_2... C_M. Circles **may** be overimposed but must reside within the square. Output in a binary file all the coordinates of the square, in a block, and then the coordinates of the circles, in M blocks. Read the values N, L, M, R_1...M and C_1..M from a text input file (not from stdin).\n",
