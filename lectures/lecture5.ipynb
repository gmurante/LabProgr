    "Let us create a few structures suitable for graphics. The basic object is a point, which we will assume has an x coordinate and\n",

    "    \n",
    "The keyword `struct` introduces a structure declaration, which is a list of declarations enclosed in braces. An **optional name called a structure tag may follow the word struct** (as with point here). The tag **names this kind of structure**, and can be used subsequently as a shorthand for the part of the declaration in braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables named in a structure are called **members**. A structure member or tag and an ordinary (i.e., non-member) variable can have the same name without conflict, since they can always be distinguished by context. Furthermore, the same member names may occur in different structures, although as a matter of style one would normally use the same names only for closely related objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "A structure declaration that is not followed by a list of variables reserves no storage; it merely describes a template or shape of a structure. If the declaration is tagged, however, the tag can be used later in definitions of instances of thestructure. For example, given the declaration of point above,\n",

    "The function `scanf` is the input analog of printf, providing many of the same conversion facilities in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "`int scanf(char *format, ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`scanf` reads characters from the standard input, interprets them according to the specification in format, and stores the results through the remaining arguments. The format argument is described below; the other arguments, **each of which must be a\n",
    "pointer**, indicate where the corresponding converted input should be stored. As with printf, this section is a summary of the\n",
    "most useful features, not an exhaustive list.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scanf` stops when it exhausts its format string, or **when some input fails to match the control specification**. It returns as its value the number of successfully matched and assigned input items. This can be used to decide how many items were found. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the end of file, EOF is returned; note that this is different from 0, which means that the next input character does not match the first specification in the format string. The next call to scanf resumes searching immediately after the last character already converted.\n",

    "An **input field** is defined as a **string of non-white space characters**; it extends either to the next white space character or until the field width, is specified, is exhausted.

    "\n",
    "The next step is to write a program that accesses a file that is not already connected to the program. One program that illustrates the need for such operations is cat, which concatenates a set of named files into the standard output. cat is used for printing files on the screen, and as a general-purpose input collector for programs that do not have the capability of accessing files by name. For example, the command\n",

Before it can be read or written, a file has to be opened by the library function `fopen`. fopen takes an external name like x.c or y.c, does some housekeeping and negotiation with the operating system (details of which needn’t concern us), and returns a pointer to be used in subsequent reads or writes of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pointer, called the **file pointer**, points to a structure that contains information about the file, such as the location of a buffer, the current character position in the buffer, whether the file is being read or written, and whether errors or end of file have occurred.

Some systems distinguish between text and *binary files*; for the latter, a *\"b\"* must be appended to the mode string.\n",

    "If a file that does not exist is opened for writing or appending, it is created if possible. **Opening an existing file for writing causes the old contents to be discarded**, while **opening for appending preserves them**.
