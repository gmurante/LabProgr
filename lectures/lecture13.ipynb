    "VP equations become the _Euler-Poisson_ equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Euler-Poisson](EuleroPoisson.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are familiar, but becomes undefined at _shell crossing_ (where more fluid elements do cross) because the density becomes infinite.\n",

    "However, doing so we do not exacly resolve the VP equations! We work in configuration space, and don't explicitly follow the evolution of the momentum part of the phase space.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    " - the density field is estimated on a grid using _massive particles_, representing _fluid elements_.\n",
    " - the density field is transformed to the Fourier space\n",
    " - the gravitational potential is computed using the green function of the Laplacian\n",
    " - the gravitational potential is transformed back and forces are evaluated\n",
    " - forces (on the mesh) are interpolated to particle\n",
    " - particles velocities are updated with a chosen time-step\n",

One can then \"smooth\" the mass on the two nearest grid cells, proportionally to the distance of the particle to the grid cell center.
