Operators specify what is to be done to them. Expressions combine variables and constants to produce new values.

Don't begin variable names with underscore, however,since library routines often use such names. Upper case and lower case letters are distinct, so x and X are two different names. Traditional C practice is to use lower case for variable names, and all upper case for symbolic constants.\n",
