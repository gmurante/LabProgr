    "Suppose we want to handle the more general problem of counting the occurrences of all the words in some input. Since the\n",
    "list of words isn’t known in advance, we can’t conveniently sort it and use a binary search. Yet we can’t do a linear search for\n",
    "each word as it arrives, to see if it’s already been seen; the program would take too long. (More precisely, its running time is\n",
    "likely to grow quadratically with the number of input words.) How can we organize the data to copy efficiently with a list or\n",
    "arbitrary words?\n",
    "One solution is to keep the set of words seen so far sorted at all times, by placing each word into its proper position in the\n",
    "order as it arrives. This shouldn’t be done by shifting words in a linear array, though - that also takes too long. Instead we\n",
    "will use a data structure called a binary tree.\n",
    "The tree contains one ‘‘node’’ per distinct word; each node contains\n",
    "A pointer to the text of the word,\n",
    "A count of the number of occurrences,\n",
    "A pointer to the left child node,\n",
    "A pointer to the right child node.\n",
    "No node may have more than two children; it might have only zero or one.\n",
    "The nodes are maintained so that at any node the left subtree contains only words that are lexicographically less than the\n",
    "word at the node, and the right subtree contains only words that are greater. This is the tree for the sentence ‘‘now is the time\n",
    "for all good men to come to the aid of their party’’, as built by inserting each word as it is encountered:\n",

    "To find out whether a new word is already in the tree, start at the root and compare the new word to the word stored at that\n",
    "node. If they match, the question is answered affirmatively. If the new record is less than the tree word, continue searching at\n",
    "the left child, otherwise at the right child. If there is no child in the required direction, the new word is not in the tree, and in\n",
    "fact the empty slot is the proper place to add the new word. This process is recursive, since the search from any node uses a\n",
    "search from one of its children. Accordingly, recursive routines for insertion and printing will be most natural.\n",
    "Going back to the description of a node, it is most conveniently represented as a structure with four components:\n",

    "int count; /* number of occurrences */\n",
    "struct tnode *left; /* left child */\n",
    "struct tnode *right; /* right child */\n",
    "};\n",
    "This recursive declaration of a node might look chancy, but it’s correct. It is illegal for a structure to contain an instance of\n",
    "itself, but\n",
    "struct tnode *left;\n",
    "declares left to be a pointer to a tnode, not a tnode itself.\n",
    "Occasionally, one needs a variation of self-referential structures: two structures that refer to each other. The way to handle\n",
